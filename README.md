## Ground Rules (Git collaboration)
- Always make your commit messages meaningful and not ambiguous or vague.
- Comment your code it helps when people review before merges.
- Always work on a separate branch before changing any code. DO NOT work on master. 
(unless it is a small change that can be made on master but always check with someone first).
- `git pull` often just because changes are likely to occur quickly and address conflicts.
- If you see that your pull request has merge conflicts __address them__ don't leave it alone.
- Message in the chats (either slack or fb messenger) if you make any additions or send PR's.
