Info201 Final project repository

## Ground Rules (Git collaboration)
- Always make your commit messages meaningful and not ambiguous or vague.
- Comment your code it helps when people review before merges.
- Always work on a separate branch before changing any code. DO NOT work on master. 
`git checkout` is a good way to check to see if you're on another branch before working
(unless it is a small change that can be made on master but always check with someone first).
- `git pull` often just because changes are likely to occur quickly and address conflicts.
- If you see that your pull request has merge conflicts __address them__ don't leave it alone.
- Message in the chats (either slack or fb messenger) if you make any additions or send PR's.

## Pull Requests
- Same with commit messages, keep your pull request descriptions clear and not ambiguous or vague.
- After pushing your branch up to GitHub make pull requests from there (should typically pop up near
the top with a message someone along the lines "new branch added" and a pull request button will typically
be there)

## Other Resources:
GitHub Desktop is a really handy way of seeing what commits you are making, changing branches, and all the things
that you don't really want to type in terminal so if you want to download that then go for it!
